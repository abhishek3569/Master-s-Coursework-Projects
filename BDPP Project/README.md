Report and ML Notebook of the Project "Implementing machine learning in Apache Spark Framework on IBM Cloud and Google Cloud Platform" in the course Big Data Parallel Programming at Halmstad University.

Performed machine learning on Default of credit card clients data set to classify which customer is more likely to default on credit card payment Parallel computation was used as data set was converted into Resilient Distributed Dataset(RDD). Pre-processing and machine learning were done using the Apache spark library which supports parallel computation
The Machine Learning Job was implemented on IBM and Google Cloud Platforms.

Tools: Apache Spark, PySpark, IBM Cloud, Google Cloud Platform
