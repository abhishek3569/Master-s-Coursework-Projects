In this academic project, we performed a Classification task to predict whether particular wine (represented by a set of measurements) comes from one of three different cultivars.

We performed Regression to identify whether it is possible to estimate the cetane number for diesel fuel from the near-infrared spectrum for the fuel from the data.
